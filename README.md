# Temp Check

**This is a little tool for checking if there are .exe files in you`re Temp Directory**

**Typically Malware likes to hide in the Temp Directory so this is just a tool for checking if there are**

⚠️ WARNING THIS TOOL IS NOT A ANTIVIRUS IT IS JUST A TOOL THAT CHECKS FOR EXES IN YOUR TEMP FOLDER AND SHOULD ONLY BE USED AS A SECOND OPINION THIS DOES NOT CHECK IF THE EXES ARE BAD OR NOT ⚠️
